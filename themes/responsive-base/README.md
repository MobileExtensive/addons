# Ovarian Canada custom theme

## Building Styles / Javascript / Images
This theme is built with the [Vanilla Cli](http://github.com/vanilla/vanilla-cli) and does not come with its own build toolchain. With that installed you can simply run:
```bash
vanilla build
```
or
```bash
vanilla build --watch
```
to build your styles/js/images. Documentation for the CLI can be found [here](http://github.com/vanilla/vanilla-cli/wiki/Build-Tools).
